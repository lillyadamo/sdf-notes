# Functions

- a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task such as printing information to the console
-  allow developers to break up complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces of code
- a fundamental concept 

## Function components

### Function identifier
- identifier (name) of the function
- named using lowercase letters, 
- if the function contains more than one word in the name, the lowercase words will be separated by underscores.

### Arguments
- Functions may receive one or more arguments, which are input values that are passed to the function
- parameters are defined within the parentheses following the function name
- Python is a dynamically typed language, the datatype of the argument is not enforced, but passing data of the wrong type could lead to unexpected results.

### Return Value
-  the output value that is returned by the function when it completes its task
- Some functions in Python do not return a value and simply perform a specific action, 
- others return one or more values.
