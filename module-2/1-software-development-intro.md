# Introduction to Software Development

Software development - the process of desitgning, writing, testing, and maintaining computer software

Tools a software dev uses include:
- Text editors
- IDE (Integrated development environments)
- Software Libraries


# Python

Python is a high level, interpreted programming language.
- Open source
- Known for readability and ease of use
- Designed to be easy to learn and use
- Syntax emphasizes readability
- Dynamically typed
- Large standard library - wide range of tools to accomplish various tasks
- widely used in web dev,scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning
- Versatile, easy to use, and strong community support

### What is a dynamically typed language?

- A dynamically typed language is a programming language where variable types are determined at runtine, rather than being explicity declared by the programmer at the compile time.

ie.

```
x = 10 # x is automatically treated as an integer
x = "hello" # x is now treated as a string
```
### Important Terms

#### Interpreted
- The interpreter reads the code line by line and executes it immediately, rather than compiling the source code into an executible before running

#### Open-Source
- anyone can contribute to the development of python
- results in libraries, frameworks and tools that can be used by python devs

#### Syntax 
-  the set of rules that define how code shuld be written such that a computer can understand and execute the instructions correctly


### Programming syntax
- set of rules that define how a programming language should be structured and written in order for the computer to understand and execute it correctly
- A violation of these rules results in a syntax error

#### Syntax error
- occur when the program violates the rules of the language's syntax

#### Logic error

- Logic errors occur when the code does not produce the expected output due to a flaw in the logic of the program
- can be difficult to detect

#### Runtime Errors
- Run-time errors occur during the execution of the program.
- can be caused by things like: dividing by zero, accessing an invalid memory location, or running out of memory

#### Other Errors
- semantic errors
- integration errors
- performance errors
- security errors
